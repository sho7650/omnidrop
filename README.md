# OmniDrop

A lightweight REST API server that bridges external applications with both OmniFocus and local file systems on macOS. Create OmniFocus tasks and manage files programmatically through a simple HTTP API with built-in observability, service management, and comprehensive testing infrastructure.

## Features

### Core Functionality
- üöÄ **Dual-purpose REST API** - Task creation + File operations
- üîê Bearer token authentication for security
- üìù OmniFocus task creation with notes, projects, and tags
- üìÇ **Secure file operations** with path traversal protection
- üèóÔ∏è **Hierarchical project support** with path-based project references
- üè∑Ô∏è **Automatic tag creation** - creates new tags in OmniFocus if they don't exist
- ‚è∞ Automatic due date setting (end of current day)

### Integration & Operations
- üçé Native OmniFocus 4 integration via enhanced AppleScript
- üìä **Prometheus metrics** for HTTP, OmniFocus, and file operations
- üìù **Structured logging** with request IDs and JSON output
- üîß **Environment-based configuration** with complete isolation (production/development/test)
- üõ†Ô∏è **Comprehensive build system** with Makefile and testing infrastructure

### Service Management
- üîÑ **Reliable LaunchAgent lifecycle management** with graceful shutdown
- üìã **Smart plist updates** - preserves custom settings by default
- üíæ **Automatic backup** with timestamped plist backups (FORCE_PLIST=1)
- üß™ **Complete testing suite** with isolated environments and production protection
- üìä **Multi-environment support** with port validation and script isolation

## Quick Start

Get up and running in 3 commands:

```bash
# 1. Clone and setup
git clone https://github.com/sho7650/omnidrop.git
cd omnidrop

# 2. Configure (edit TOKEN)
cp .env.example .env

# 3. Install and start service
make install
```

Your OmniDrop server is now running at `http://localhost:8787`!

## Prerequisites

- macOS (required for OmniFocus and AppleScript)
- OmniFocus 4 or later installed and running
- Go 1.25.0 or later
- Python 3 (for JSON parsing in AppleScript)

## Installation

### Production Installation (Recommended)

Full installation with automatic service management and proper lifecycle handling:

```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/sho7650/omnidrop.git
cd omnidrop

# Configure environment
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env and set your secure TOKEN

# Install everything with proper service lifecycle
make install

# Update installation (preserves existing plist)
make install

# Force plist update (creates automatic backup)
make install FORCE_PLIST=1
```

The install process:
1. **üõë Stops** existing service gracefully
2. **üì§ Unloads** service completely to prevent conflicts
3. **üìÅ Installs** files (binary, script, plist)
4. **üíæ Protects** existing plist configuration (unless FORCE_PLIST=1)
5. **üöÄ Loads** with persistence (`-w` flag) for reliable startup
6. **‚úÖ Verifies** service startup with user feedback

This installs:
- Binary: `~/bin/omnidrop-server` (with graceful shutdown support)
- AppleScript: `~/.local/share/omnidrop/omnidrop.applescript`
- LaunchAgent: `~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.oshiire.omnidrop.plist`
- Logs: `~/.local/log/omnidrop/`
- Files: `~/.local/share/omnidrop/files/` (configurable via OMNIDROP_FILES_DIR)

**Plist Update Behavior:**
- **Default (`make install`)**: Preserves existing plist to protect custom settings
- **Force (`FORCE_PLIST=1`)**: Updates plist with automatic timestamped backup
- **New installation**: Always creates plist from template

### Development Installation

For development and testing with complete environment isolation:

```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/sho7650/omnidrop.git
cd omnidrop

# Install dependencies
make deps

# Configure environment
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env and set your TOKEN

# Run isolated development server (port 8788)
make dev-isolated

# Or run with direct go run
TOKEN=dev-token make dev
```

## Environment Management

OmniDrop supports complete environment separation for safe development and testing:

### Environment Variables

**Required:**
- `TOKEN`: Bearer token for API authentication

**Environment Control:**
- `OMNIDROP_ENV`: Environment mode (`production`, `development`, `test`)
- `PORT`: Server port (8787=production, 8788-8799=test range)
- `OMNIDROP_SCRIPT`: Explicit path to AppleScript file (overrides auto-detection)
- `OMNIDROP_FILES_DIR`: Base directory for file operations (default: `~/.local/share/omnidrop/files`)

### Environment-Specific Configuration

The server automatically selects appropriate configurations:

| Environment | Port Range | Script Location | Use Case |
|-------------|------------|-----------------|----------|
| `production` | 8787 (protected) | `~/.local/share/omnidrop/omnidrop.applescript` | Production deployment |
| `development` | Any | `./omnidrop.applescript` | Local development |
| `test` | 8788-8799 | Isolated test location | Automated testing |

### Multi-Environment Commands

```bash
# Development (port 8788)
make dev-isolated

# Staging/Testing (port 8790)
TOKEN=test-token make staging

# Production (port 8787, with confirmation)
TOKEN=prod-token make production-run
```

## Service Management

### Basic Service Control

```bash
# Start service
make start

# Stop service (now works reliably with graceful shutdown)
make stop

# Check service status
make status

# View logs (last 20 lines)
make logs

# Follow logs in real-time
make logs-follow

# Restart service
make stop && make start
```

### Advanced Service Management

```bash
# Check detailed service status
launchctl list | grep com.oshiire.omnidrop

# Manual service control (if needed)
launchctl stop com.oshiire.omnidrop
launchctl start com.oshiire.omnidrop

# Reinstall service with proper lifecycle
make install  # Now idempotent and safe to run multiple times
```

## Testing Infrastructure

### Comprehensive Testing Suite

```bash
# Run pre-flight validation (checks environment safety)
make test-preflight

# Run complete isolated test suite (7 comprehensive tests)
make test-isolated

# Run standard Go tests
make test
```

### Test Environments

**Isolated Testing:**
- Complete environment separation from production
- Temporary test directories and AppleScript files
- Port range validation (8788-8799)
- Automatic cleanup after testing

**Production Protection:**
- Port 8787 reserved for production only
- Production script path protection
- Environment variable validation
- Pre-flight safety checks

### Test Coverage

The test suite covers:
1. ‚úÖ Simple task creation (no tags)
2. ‚úÖ Task with existing tags
3. ‚úÖ Task with automatic tag creation
4. ‚úÖ Task with mixed existing and new tags
5. ‚úÖ Task with hierarchical project assignment
6. ‚úÖ Complex task with all features
7. ‚úÖ Invalid request handling (authorization)

## Development

### Available Make Targets

**Development:**
```bash
make dev              # Run with go run (requires TOKEN env var)
make dev-isolated     # Run isolated development server (port 8788)
make run              # Build and run binary
make build            # Build binary only
make test             # Run standard Go tests
make test-isolated    # Run comprehensive isolated test suite
make test-preflight   # Run environment validation checks
```

**Environment Management:**
```bash
make staging          # Run staging environment (port 8790)
make production-run   # Run production server (port 8787, protected)
```

**Installation & Service:**
```bash
make install          # Install with proper LaunchAgent lifecycle
make uninstall        # Complete removal
make clean            # Clean build artifacts
make deps             # Download dependencies
```

**Service Management:**
```bash
make start            # Start service (now reliable)
make stop             # Stop service (graceful shutdown)
make status           # Check status
make logs             # Show recent logs
make logs-follow      # Follow logs real-time
make help             # Show all available targets
```

### Development Workflow

```bash
# Safe development cycle
TOKEN="dev-token" make dev-isolated    # Isolated development (port 8788)
make test-preflight                    # Validate environment safety
make test-isolated                     # Run comprehensive tests
make build                             # Build binary

# When ready for production testing
TOKEN="staging-token" make staging     # Staging test (port 8790)

# Production deployment
make install                           # Install with proper lifecycle
make status                            # Verify service
make logs                              # Check logs
```

### Testing Best Practices

**Always use test environments:**
```bash
# ‚úÖ Good: Use test ports
make dev-isolated    # port 8788
make staging         # port 8790

# ‚ùå Bad: Never use production port for testing
# PORT=8787 # NEVER for testing
```

**Run validation before changes:**
```bash
make test-preflight  # Check environment safety
make test-isolated   # Run full test suite
```

  "tags": ["urgent", "new-feature", "auto-created-tag"]
}
```
- Existing tags are applied normally
- Non-existent tags are automatically created in OmniFocus
- Multi-strategy tag assignment with fallback mechanisms

**Response:**

Success (200 OK):
```json
{
  "status": "ok",
  "created": true
}
```

Error (4xx/5xx):
```json
{
  "status": "error",

  "directory": "reports/2025"               // Optional: Subdirectory path within base directory
}
```

**Security Features:**
- Path traversal protection prevents access outside base directory (`~/.local/share/omnidrop/files/` by default)
- Automatic directory creation for nested structures
- File overwrite protection (returns error if file exists)
- Configurable base directory via `OMNIDROP_FILES_DIR` environment variable

**Response:**

Success (200 OK):
```json
{
  "status": "ok",
  "created": true,
  "path": "reports/2025/report.txt"
}
```

Error (4xx/5xx):
```json
{
  "status": "error",
  "created": false,
  "reason": "Error description"
}
```

### Health Check

Returns server status and version information.

### Metrics

**Endpoint:** `GET /metrics`

Exposes Prometheus-compatible metrics (no authentication required):
- HTTP request metrics (rate, duration, size)
- OmniFocus operation metrics (success/failure, duration)
- File operation metrics (success/failure, duration)

## How It Works

### 1. HTTP Server (`cmd/omnidrop-server/main.go`)
- Receives POST requests with task data
- Validates Bearer token authentication
- **Environment-aware AppleScript path resolution**
- **Graceful shutdown with SIGTERM handling**
- **Production environment protection and validation**
- Passes task data to AppleScript bridge

### 2. Enhanced AppleScript Bridge (`omnidrop.applescript`)
- **OmniFocus 4 compatibility** with proper API usage
- **Hierarchical project resolution** with folder navigation
- **Multi-strategy tag assignment** with automatic tag creation
- **Comprehensive error handling** with detailed logging
- Parses JSON data using Python integration
- Sets due date to 23:59:59 of current day

### 3. Service Management (`Makefile` + `init/launchd/`)
- **Proper LaunchAgent lifecycle management** (stop ‚Üí unload ‚Üí install ‚Üí load -w)
- **Idempotent installation** - safe to run multiple times
- **Environment-specific configuration** with production protection
- **Comprehensive testing infrastructure** with isolation
- Provides service control commands with validation
- Manages logs and configuration

## Important Notes

### Project and Tag Handling
- **Hierarchical Projects**: Use path format like `"Folder/Subfolder/Project"`
- **Simple Projects**: Use exact project name like `"Work"`
- **Automatic Tag Creation**: New tags are automatically created in OmniFocus
- **Tag Assignment**: Multi-strategy approach with fallback mechanisms
- **Due Dates**: All tasks are automatically set to due at end of current day (23:59:59)
- **Inbox**: Tasks without a project are created in the OmniFocus inbox

### Environment Safety
- **Production Protection**: Port 8787 is protected and requires explicit confirmation
- **Environment Isolation**: Complete separation between development, test, and production
- **Script Isolation**: Each environment uses its own AppleScript file
- **Test Port Range**: 8788-8799 reserved for testing to prevent production conflicts

### Service Management
- **Graceful Shutdown**: Server properly handles SIGTERM for reliable `launchctl stop`
- **Reliable Startup**: LaunchAgent loads with `-w` flag for persistence
- **Idempotent Install**: `make install` can be run multiple times safely
- **Service Validation**: Install process verifies successful startup

## Troubleshooting

### Service Issues

**Service won't start:**
```bash
make status                    # Check if service is loaded
make logs                      # Check for error messages
make test-preflight           # Validate environment
launchctl list | grep omnidrop  # Verify LaunchAgent status
```

**Service keeps crashing or won't stop:**
```bash
make logs                      # Check error logs
make uninstall                 # Clean removal with proper lifecycle
make install                   # Fresh installation with validation
```

**Installation conflicts:**
```bash
# The new install process handles this automatically:
make install                   # Stops ‚Üí unloads ‚Üí installs ‚Üí loads ‚Üí verifies
```

### Environment Issues

**Wrong environment or port conflicts:**
```bash
make test-preflight           # Comprehensive environment validation
echo $OMNIDROP_ENV           # Check current environment
echo $PORT                   # Check current port
```

**Production environment protection:**
```bash
# If accidentally using production resources:
unset OMNIDROP_ENV PORT OMNIDROP_SCRIPT  # Clear environment
make dev-isolated             # Use safe development environment
```

### API Issues

**"AppleScript error" Response:**
- Ensure OmniFocus 4 is running
- Check that project paths use correct folder hierarchy
- Verify Python 3 is installed: `python3 --version`
- Check AppleScript permissions in System Preferences
- Review AppleScript logs for detailed error information

**Tag creation issues:**
- New tags are automatically created - no manual setup needed
- Check OmniFocus tags section to verify new tags were created
- Review AppleScript logs for tag assignment details

**"Unauthorized" Response:**
- Verify the token in your `.env` file matches the request
- Ensure the Authorization header format is: `Bearer <token>`
- Check if `.env` file is being loaded: look for log message on startup

**"Server Won't Start":**
- Check if port is already in use: `lsof -i :8787`
- Run environment validation: `make test-preflight`
- Verify `.env` file exists and TOKEN is set
- Check file permissions on AppleScript file

### Development Issues

**Build failures:**
```bash
make clean                    # Clean build artifacts
make deps                     # Reinstall dependencies
go mod tidy                   # Clean module dependencies
```

**Test failures:**
```bash
make test-preflight          # Check environment setup
make test-isolated           # Run isolated test suite
# Check logs for specific test failure details
```

**Environment loading issues:**
```bash
TOKEN=test-token make dev-isolated  # Use explicit token
ls -la .env                  # Verify .env file exists
# Check OMNIDROP_ENV, PORT, OMNIDROP_SCRIPT variables
```

### Log Analysis

```bash
# View recent logs with timestamps
make logs

# Follow logs in real-time for debugging
make logs-follow

# View specific log files
tail -f ~/.local/log/omnidrop/stdout.log
tail -f ~/.local/log/omnidrop/stderr.log

# Check AppleScript execution logs for task creation details
grep -i "tag\|project\|error" ~/.local/log/omnidrop/stdout.log
```

## Security Considerations

- **Token Storage**: Never commit `.env` files with real tokens
- **Environment Separation**: Use different tokens for development/staging/production
- **HTTPS**: Use a reverse proxy (nginx/caddy) for HTTPS in production
- **Token Rotation**: Regularly rotate your authentication tokens
- **Network Access**: Bind to localhost only unless external access is required
- **File Permissions**: Ensure proper permissions on `.env` and log files
- **Service Security**: LaunchAgent runs as user, not root (safer)
- **Port Protection**: Production port 8787 is protected from accidental test usage
- **File Operations**: Path traversal protection prevents access outside configured base directory
- **Metrics Endpoint**: `/metrics` endpoint is public - use firewall rules if external access is restricted

## Uninstalling

Complete removal of OmniDrop with proper service lifecycle:

```bash
make uninstall
```

This safely removes:
- Stops and unloads the LaunchAgent service
- Binary from `~/bin/`
- AppleScript from `~/.local/share/omnidrop/`
- LaunchAgent from `~/Library/LaunchAgents/`
- Log directory from `~/.local/log/omnidrop/`
- Configuration from `~/.config/omnidrop/`
